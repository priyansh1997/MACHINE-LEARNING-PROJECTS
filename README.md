# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS
CONTAIN PROJECTS ON ALMOST ALL THE ALGOS WHICH ARE  POPULAR IN MARKET 
ML IS A BRANCH OF AI IN WHICH A MACHINE IS EXPLICITLY TRAINED FOR TAKING SOME DECISIONS AS PER THE CURRENT AND PAST EXPERIENCE. WE CREATE A MODEL WHICH IS TRAINED ON A DATASET AND GET TESTED ON SAMPLE DATASET.
WE GIVE COMPUTER THE ABILITY TO LEARN WITHOUT BEING EXPLICITLY PROGRAMMED.
ARTHUR SAMUEL OF IBM FIRST CAME UP WITH THE NAME MACHINE LEARNING IN 1950.
TYPES OF ML STRATEGIES:-
1. SUPERVISED LEARNING        =>DATA HAS KNOWN LABELS
2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING      =>DATA DOESN'T HAVE  KNOWN LABELS
3. SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING   =>LABELS ARE KNOWN FOR A SUBSET OF DATA
4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING     =>IT ANALYZES AND OPTIMIZES THE BEHAVIOUR OF AN AGENT BASED ON THE FEEDBACK FROM THE ENVIRONMENT


# GLOSSARY:
1. BIAS METRIC:- AVG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREDICTION AND CORRECT VALUE
2. LOW BIAS:- MEANS MOST OF THE PREDICTIONS ARE CORRECT i.e. HALF ARE ABOVE ORIGINAL VALUE AND HALF ARE BELOW ORIGINAL
3. HIGH BIAS:- MEANS MODEL IS UNDERFIITING USING WRONG ALGO
4. CONFUSION METRIX:- DESCRIBES PERFORMANCE OF CLASSIFICATION MODEL
5. DIMENSION:- MEANS HOW MANY FEATURES OUR DATA HAVE
6. HYPERPARAMETERS:- HIGHER LEVEL PROPERTIES OF A MODEL
7. NORMALIZATION:- RESTRICTION OF VALUES OF WEIGHTS IN REGRESSION MODEL TO AVOID OVERFITTING AND IMPROVEMENT IN SPEED
8. NOISE:- AN IRRELEVANT INFORMATION OR RANDOMNESS IN DATASET
9. OVERFITTING:- WHEN MODEL LEARN THE TRAINING DATA TOO WELL AND PERFORMS POORLY ON TEST SET
10. VARIANCE:- PREDICTION WHICH TELLS US THE SPREAD OF OUR DATA
11. HIGH VARIANCE:- MODEL MAY BE OVERFITTING AND READING TOO DEEPLY INTO THE NOISE
