# SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE 
THIS ALGO IS USED FOR CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS. WE PROVIDE A LINE OR HYPERPLANE TO SEPARATE THE DATAPOINTS. THAT HYPERPLANE IS DRAWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUPPORT VECTORS.
IF WE CHOOSE A HYPERPLANE WITH LOW MARGINS THAN THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF HIGH DISCLASSIFICATION OF NEW POINTS.
HERE KERNEL CONVERTS LOWER DIMENSIONAL DATA TO HIGH DIMENSION DATA.
