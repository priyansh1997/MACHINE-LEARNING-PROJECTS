# GRADIENT BOOSTING
HERE WE USE THE WEAK LEARNERS OR FEATURES WHICH WEAKENS THE LEARNING WITH STRONG FEATURES TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY. IT IS ENSEMBLE LEARNING TECHNIQUE USED TO INCREASE MODEL PERFORMANCE.
STEPS:-
1. BASE ALGO WILL READ THE DATA AND ASSIGN EQUAL WEIGHT TO EACH SAMPLE OBSERVATION.
2. NOW A SINGLE LEVEL DECISION TREE IS DRAWN(DECISION STUMP).
3. FALSE PREDICTION IS DESIGNED TO THE NEXT BASE LEARNERS WITH HIGHER WEIGHTAGE TO NEXT BASE LEARNER WITH HIGHER WEIGHTAGE ON THESE INCORRECT PREDICTIONS TO  SEPARATE  THEM AND CORRECTLY CLASSIFY.
4. REPEAT THE SECOND STEP UNTIL THE ALGO CORRECTLY CLASSIFY.
